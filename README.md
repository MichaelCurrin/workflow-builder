## About

I like using GitHub Actions across a lot of my projects. I make notes on syntax, allowed values and some common flows for Node and Python projects. But to make it even easier to create or edit a workflow, I made this project.

The aim is not to cover all features in GH Actions, but rather to cover the parts that are relevant for my own projects.

This site is built on Jekyll, but that might change. To keep things light, there are not files for local dev, like a config or Gemfile.


## Development

This site is built on Jekyll static generator and hosted with GitHub Pages.

It just a one-page site that is not intended to be run locally, so there are no Jekyll configs.

To deploy your copy of this site, enable _GitHub Pages_ under _Settings_ of your repo.
