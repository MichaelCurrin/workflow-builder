## About

I like using GitHub Actions across a lot of my projects. I make notes on syntax, allowed values and some common flows for Node and Python projects. But to make it even easier to create or edit a workflow, I made this project.

The aim is not to cover all features in GH Actions, but rather to cover the parts that are relevant for my own projects.
