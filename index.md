Contributions via issues, PRs and [Discussions](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/workflow-builder/discussions) are welcome.


## Tips

If you want to know available options for a workflow and if you YAML syntax is valid, edit your workflow on GitHub rather than in a local file. Click on a field or at an indent level where you want to add a field, the press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd>. You'll see available options for that context. This can save reading through the docs.


## Resources

- To learn about GH Actions from GitHub's docs, see links in my [Resources](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/ci-cd/github-actions/) list.
- To understand the workflow syntax with some practical examples, see [GitHub Actions](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/) in my Dev Cheatsheets.


## Name

Example names for your workflow:

```yaml
name: CI
```
```yaml
name: CI Build
```
```yaml
name: CI Test
```
```yaml
name: Node CI
```
```yaml
name: Deno CI
```
```yaml
name: Python CI
```
```yaml
name: Deno CI
```
```yaml
name: GH Pages CI
```
```yaml
name: Release
```


## Triggers

For more options such as building on schedule, see my [Triggers](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/triggers.html) cheatsheet.

### On a commit push

Push a local commit or commit using the GitHub UI to trigger these `on` conditions.

- `main.yml` - The simplest approach. Builds on _any_ branch, regardless of Pull Requests.
    ```yaml
    on: push
    ```
- `main.yml` - Builds on a chosen branch only.
  ```yaml
    on:
      push:
          branches: main
  ```
- `main.yml` - Triggered on a commit or push to your main branch or any branch with a Pull Request. Ignores doc changes.
    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
          branches: main
          paths-ignore:
            - 'docs/**'
      pull_request:
          branches: main
          paths-ignore:
            - 'docs/**'
    ```

The workflow above is setup to not run if there are just changes in your `docs` directory. This is useful to reduce a run that gives no benefit and would still take up processing minutes allocate to your account. If you actually have content in your `docs` directory that matters like for a documentation site, then of course you can remove the ignore parts.

### On a tag or release

Create a tag or a release to trigger your workflow.

- `release.yml`
    ```yaml
    on:
      release:
        types: created
    ```
- `tag.yml`
    ```yaml
    on:
    push:
        tags:
          - 'v*'
    ```

### Manual

Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```


## Operating systems

Run on Ubuntu.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    name: Your job name

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Run on a matrix of operating systems. Note that quotes not needed for a YAML array.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest]
      runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```


## Steps

This section covers some common snippets across languages, for some of my common build, test and deploy flows.

For more details, please explore the [Workflows](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/) section in my Code Cookbook.

That covers:

- Recipes for languages like Python, Ruby, Node, Deno and Go.
- How to choose and configure Actions from the Marketplace.
- Plus how to do tasks like cache assets, build any app to GH Pages (e.g. React, Vue, Next, MkDocs), build a Jekyll 4 site or to build and release assets.

### Checkout

Using the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
```


### Setup environment

#### Node

[Node CI samples](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/node/).

GH Actions comes with Node and Yarn setup already. But you can use an action if you ned more recent version, or to use a matrix of Node or Yarn versions.

Using the [setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v2
    with:
      node-version: '14.x'
```

Use a matrix of Node versions.

```yaml
steps:
  strategy:
    matrix:
      node-version: [10.x, 12.x, 14.x]

  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

#### Deno

[Deno CI samples](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/deno/).

Using the [setup-deno](https://github.com/denolib/setup-deno) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: denolib/setup-deno@v2
    with:
    deno-version: v1.x
```

#### Go

[Go CI samples](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/go/).

Using the [setup-go](https://github.com/actions/setup-go) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Set up Go
    uses: actions/setup-go@v2
    with:
      go-version: 1.15
```

#### Python

[Python CI samples](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/python/install-deps.html).

Using the [setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v2
    with:
      python-version: 3.x
```

#### Ruby

Using the [setup-ruby](https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby) action.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-ruby@v1
    with:
      ruby-version: 2.7
```

#### Jekyll

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build Jekyll site
    run: |
      docker run \
        -v $:/srv/jekyll \
        -v $/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
        jekyll/builder:4 \
        /bin/bash -c 'chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future'
```


### Install dependencies

This section is not needed for Go or Deno where packages are installed on running, building, testing, etc.

See GH Actions [Cache](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/cache.html) guide.

Using the [cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action.

#### Python

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Cache dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
      path: ~/.cache/pip
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('docs/requirements.txt') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-pip-
        ${{ runner.os }}-
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Node

See related workflows [here](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/node/npm.html).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Cache Node.js modules
    uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.OS }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.OS }}-node-
        ${{ runner.OS }}-
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
```

#### Yarn

This uses Yarn's cache directory. On Ubuntu this is `~/.cache/yarn/v6`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Get yarn cache
    id: yarn-cache
    run: echo "::set-output name=dir::$(yarn cache dir)"

  - uses: actions/cache@v1
    with:
      path: ${{ steps.yarn-cache.outputs.dir }}
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-
```

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: yarn install
```

### Ruby

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Get cached gems
    uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
      path: vendor/bundle
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}
      restore-keys: |
        ${{ runner.os }}-gems-

  - name: Install gems
    run: |
      bundle config set path vendor/bundle
      bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
```


## GitHub Pages

For more info and related workflows and actions, see [GH Pages](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/code-cookbook/recipes/ci-cd/github-actions/workflows/deploy-gh-pages/) in my Code Cookbook.

```yaml
- name: Deploy ðŸš€
  if: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' }}
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: _site
```

Sequence:

1. To deploy your application, first run the build command for Jekyll or your Node app (e.g. React, Vue or Next.js).
2. Then setup this action to point to that directory e.g. in `_site` or `build`.
3. The action will copy the content root of the `gh-pages` branch (this it is default behavior).
4. When that commit is pushed, then your GH Pages site will reload, using the latest content.

Note the use of the `if` condition on this step. This means that your entire workflow can run on a push to your main branch. But on a push to a Pull Request branch, the earlier build steps will run but the deploy step at the end will be skipped. This is useful to avoid deploy your work in progress branch to your production site.


## Future development

After some more content, I'll add interactivity - like using React to control a form and YAML output.
